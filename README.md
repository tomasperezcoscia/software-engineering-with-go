This repository documents my journey mastering Computer Science fundamentals using Go. My goal is to deepen my understanding of backend engineering and system design.

Every line of code will be written by me, i'll be following the guidance of the coding-interview-university repo.

I'll use claude as a "Teacher" whenever i do not understand a concept. And to point to errors in my implementation.
